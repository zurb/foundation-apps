<h2>Touch Gestures</h2>

<h3 class="subheader">Touch gestures are often used in devices like tablets and phones to make apps more accessible and intuitive to use. We have integrated Hammer.JS into our Angular core to create easy-to-use directives for gesture-based actions.</h3>

  <h3>Hammer.js Required</h3>

  <p>Our touch directives use the <a href="http://hammerjs.github.io/">Hammer.js</a>, library, which makes it easy to hook into common touch actions like swiping, pinching, rotating, and more. Our starter project (installed through the CLI) includes Hammer.js by default.</p>

  <h3>Swipe Settings</h3>
  <p>A <code>SwipeSettings</code> provider exists to allow fine tuning of the swipe detection used for a touch directive.</p>

  <h4>Distance</h4>
  <p>The minimum swipe distance in px.  Named distances can be created to assist with the swipe configuration.  The following named distances exist by default: <code>short</code>, <code>normal</code>, <code>far</code></p>
  <p>The default named distances can be cleared by calling <code>SwipeSettingsProvider.clearDistances()</code></p>
  <p>A named distance can be added by calling <code>SwipeSettingsProvider.addDistance(name, value)</code></p>

  <h4>Velocity</h4>
  <p>The minimum swipe speed in px/ms.  Named velocities can be created to assist with the swipe configuration.  The following named velocities exist by default: <code>slow</code>, <code>normal</code>, <code>fast</code></p>
  <p>The default named velocities can be cleared by calling <code>SwipeSettingsProvider.clearVelocitys()</code></p>
  <p>A named velocity can be added by calling <code>SwipeSettingsProvider.addVelocity(name, value)</code></p>

  <h3>Swipe to Close</h3>

  <p>Add the <code>zf-swipe-close</code> directive to a closable element, such as a panel, off-canvas menu, modal, or notification, to trigger a close when the user swipes over the component. The swipe direction is set on the directive, and can be either <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>left</code>, or <code>right</code>.</p>

  <section>
    <h4>Example Panel</h4>

    <p>Here's an example of the swipe-to-close directive applied to a panel.</p>

    <div class="grid-block">
      <div class="small-12 medium-6 grid-content">
<hljs language="html">
<div zf-panel zf-swipe-close="left" class="docs-example-panel" id="example-touch-panel">
  <a zf-close class="close-button">&times;</a>
  <p>Swipe to the left to close this panel.</p>
</div>
</hljs>
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-6 grid-content">
        <a class="button" zf-toggle="example-touch-panel">Swipe Panel</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Example Modal</h4>

    <p>In this example, the user can swipe up to dismiss the modal. We paired this gesture with an animation that slides the modal up as it fades out, by setting <code>animation-out="slideOutUp"</code> on the element.</p>

    <div class="grid-block">
      <div class="small-12 medium-6 grid-content">
<hljs language="html">
<div zf-modal zf-swipe-close="up" animation-out="slideOutUp" id="example-touch-modal" class="tiny dialog">
  <p>Swipe up on this modal to close it.</p>
</div>
</hljs>
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-6 grid-content">
        <a class="button" zf-toggle="example-touch-modal">Swipe Modal</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <h3>Evaluate on Swipe</h3>
  <p>Similar to how <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClick">ng-click</a> allows you to specify custom behavior when an element is clicked, <code>zf-swipe</code> allows you to specify custom behavior when an element is swiped.</p>

  <section>
    <h4>Expression</h4>
    <p>The expression to evaluate when the swipe is triggered.  The expression is provided as the value for the zf-swipe attribute.</p>

    <div class="grid-block" ng-init="swipeCount1 = 0">
      <div class="grid-content small-12 medium-6">
<hljs>
  <div zf-swipe="swipeCount = swipeCount + 1">
    <p>Element has been swiped {{ swipeCount }} times.</p>
  </div>
</hljs>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-content small-12 medium-6 text-center" zf-swipe="swipeCount1 = swipeCount1 + 1" style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 2rem">
        <p>Element has been swiped {{ swipeCount1 }} times.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Direction</h4>
    <p>The direction the element must be swiped.  When not specified, the element can be swiped in any direction.</p>

    <div class="grid-block" ng-init="swipeCount2 = 0">
      <div class="grid-content small-12 medium-6">
<hljs>
  <div zf-swipe="swipeCount = swipeCount + 1" direction="left">
    <p>Element has been swiped LEFT {{ swipeCount }} times.</p>
  </div>
</hljs>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-content small-12 medium-6 text-center" zf-swipe="swipeCount2 = swipeCount2 + 1" direction="left" style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 2rem">
        <p>Element has been swiped {{ swipeCount2 }} times.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Distance</h4>
    <p>A named distance to use for the swipe detection.  When not specified, the default Hammer value is used.</p>

    <div class="grid-block" ng-init="swipeCount3 = 0">
      <div class="grid-content small-12 medium-6">
<hljs>
  <div zf-swipe="swipeCount = swipeCount + 1" distance="far">
    <p>Element has been swiped {{ swipeCount }} times.</p>
  </div>
</hljs>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-content small-12 medium-6 text-center" zf-swipe="swipeCount3 = swipeCount3 + 1" distance="far" style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 2rem">
        <p>Element has been swiped {{ swipeCount3 }} times.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <p>A named velocity to use for the swipe detection.  When not specified, the default Hammer value is used.</p>

    <div class="grid-block" ng-init="swipeCount4 = 0">
      <div class="grid-content small-12 medium-6">
<hljs>
  <div zf-swipe="swipeCount = swipeCount + 1" velocity="fast">
    <p>Element has been swiped {{ swipeCount }} times.</p>
  </div>
</hljs>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-content small-12 medium-6 text-center" zf-swipe="swipeCount4 = swipeCount4 + 1" velocity="fast" style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 2rem">
        <p>Element has been swiped {{ swipeCount4 }} times.</p>
      </div>

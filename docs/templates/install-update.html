<h2>Install and Update</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">Ready to make sweet web apps? Setup is straight forward and if you haven't used Sass before, once you do, you'll never look back.</h3>

<h3>Quick Install: Using our CLI</h3>

<p>Just like with Foundation for Sites, we wrote an awesome command-line tool to make setting up new Foundation for Apps projects a breeze. The CLI downloads a template project that uses Foundation, Angular, Sass, and Gulp. If you'd rather install our components into your own stack, see our advanced instructions below.</p>

  <div class="small-12 medium-4 grid-content">
    <h5>Node.js</h5>
    <p>Node allows you to run JavaScript outside of a web browser, and it powers several tools we use in the development process, like Bower and Gulp.</p>

    <h5>Git</h5>
    <p>Git is a version control system used to collaboratively develop software. The package manager Bower uses Git to download software onto your computer.</p>

    <h5>Ruby</h5>
    <p>Ruby powers Sass, the CSS preprocessor Foundation for Apps is written in. To compile the CSS that powers our components, you'll need Ruby and Sass on your machine. If you already have Ruby installed, make sure you're using at least version 1.8.7.</p>

<h4>Install Instructions</h4>

<p>With the above software installed, open up your command line. Start by installing the Foundation CLI, Bower, and Gulp using Node:</p>

<hljs language="bash">
npm install -g foundation-cli bower gulp
</hljs>

<p>If you don't have Bundler installed, you'll want to install that as well:</p>

<hljs language="bash">
gem install bundler
</hljs>

<p>You now have access to the `foundation-apps` command on your system! You'll use this to setup and update new projects. To build a new project, use this command:</p>

<hljs language="bash">
foundation-apps new myApp
</hljs>

<p>Change <code>myApp</code> to the name you'd like the folder to be. This will download our template stack, and install Foundation for Apps, Angular, and Gulp. The whole process takes between 30 seconds and a minute, depending on your Internet connection.</p>

<p>Once the installer is done, navigate into the directory using <code>cd:</code></p>

<hljs language="bash">
cd myApp
</hljs>

<p>Now you can build the app and begin working on it.</p>

<hljs language="bash">
foundation-apps watch
</hljs>

This will assemble all of the pieces&mdash;the Angular components, Sass, and views&mdash;into a new folder called <code>build</code>, which is your final app. The build process will also setup a temporary server that points to the finished app. You can get to the server by going to this URL in your browser:

<hljs language="bash" no-escape>
http://localhost:8080
</hljs>

<hr>

<h3>Manual Install</h3>

<p>Foundation for Apps can be installed manually through Bower</p>

<hljs language="bash">
bower install foundation-apps
</hljs>

<p>The package includes these folders:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>bin</strong> The dynamic routing plugin for Gulp and UI Router.</li>
  <li><strong>scss:</strong> The Sass components.</li>
  <li><strong>js:</strong> The Angular modules and directives, and other external libraries.</li>
  <li><strong>iconic:</strong> A set of 24 icons from the folks at Iconic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Install and Update</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">Ready to make sweet web apps? Setup is straight forward and if you haven't used Sass before, once you do, you'll never look back.</h3>

<h3>Quick Install: Using our CLI</h3>

<p>Just like with Foundation for Sites, we wrote an awesome command-line tool to make setting up new Foundation for Apps projects a breeze. The CLI downloads a template project that uses Foundation, Angular, Sass, and Gulp. If you'd rather install our components into your own stack, see our advanced instructions below.</p>

<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="small-12 medium-4 grid-content">
    <h5>Node.js</h5>
    <p>Node allows you to run JavaScript outside of a web browser, and it powers several tools we use in the development process, like Bower and Gulp.</p>

  <div class="small-12 medium-4 grid-content">
    <h5>Git</h5>
    <p>Git is a version control system used to collaboratively develop software. The package manager Bower uses Git to download software onto your computer.</p>

  <div class="small-12 medium-4 grid-content">
    <h5>Ruby</h5>
    <p>Ruby powers Sass, the CSS preprocessor Foundation for Apps is written in. To compile the CSS that powers our components, you'll need Ruby and Sass on your machine.</p>

<p>If you already have Node installed, make sure you have the newest version of npm&mdash;use <code>npm update -g update</code> to update. If you already have Ruby installed, make sure you're using at least version 1.8.7.</p>

<h4>Install Instructions</h4>

<p>With the above software installed, open up your command line. Start by installing the Foundation CLI, Bower, and Gulp using Node:</p>

<hljs language="bash">
npm install -g foundation-cli bower gulp
</hljs>

<p>If you don't have Bundler installed, you'll want to install that as well:</p>

<hljs language="bash">
gem install bundler
</hljs>

<p>You now have access to the `foundation-apps` command on your system! You'll use this to setup and update new projects. To build a new project, use this command:</p>

<hljs language="bash">
foundation-apps new myApp
</hljs>

<p>Change <code>myApp</code> to the name you'd like the folder to be. This will download our template stack, and install Foundation for Apps, Angular, and Gulp. The whole process takes between 30 seconds and a minute, depending on your Internet connection.</p>

<p>Once the installer is done, navigate into the directory using <code>cd:</code></p>

<hljs language="bash">
cd myApp
</hljs>

<p>Now you can build the app and begin working on it.</p>

<hljs language="bash">
foundation-apps watch
</hljs>

<p>This will assemble all of the pieces&mdash;the Angular components, Sass, and views&mdash;into a new folder called <code>build</code>, which is your final app. The build process will also setup a temporary server that points to the finished app. You can get to the server by going to this URL in your browser:</p>

<hljs language="bash" no-escape>
http://localhost:8080
</hljs>

<hr>

<h3>Manual Install</h3>

<p>Foundation for Apps can be installed manually through Bower</p>

<hljs language="bash">
bower install foundation-apps
</hljs>

<p>The package includes these folders:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>bin</strong> The dynamic routing plugin for Gulp and UI Router.</li>
  <li><strong>scss:</strong> The Sass components.</li>
  <li><strong>js:</strong> The Angular modules and directives, and other external libraries.</li>
  <li><strong>iconic:</strong> A set of 24 icons from the folks at Iconic.</li>
</ul>
